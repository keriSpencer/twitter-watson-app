        <h3>Risky Behavior</h3>
        <p>https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-faq/index.shtml#pub8</p>
        <p>
          According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 'The risk for suicidal behavior is complex. Research
          suggests that people who attempt suicide differ from others in many aspects of how they think, react to
          events, and make decisions. There are differences in aspects of memory, attention, planning, and emotion, for
          example. These differences often occur along with disorders like depression, substance use, anxiety, and
          psychosis. Sometimes suicidal behavior is triggered by events such as personal loss or violence. In order to
          be able to detect those at risk and prevent suicide, it is crucial that we understand the role of both
          long-term factors—such as experiences in childhood—and more immediate factors like mental health and recent
          life events. Researchers are also looking at how genes can either increase risk or make someone more resilient
          to loss and hardships.'

        <h3>Suicide is a Leading Cause of Death in the United States</h3>
        <p>Suicide is a Leading Cause of Death in the United States</p>
        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015</p>
        <ul>
          <li className="liStats">
            Suicide was the tenth leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of more than
            44,000 people.
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            Suicide was the third leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 and 14, and the second
            leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 15 and 34.
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            There were more than twice as many suicides (44,193) in the United States as there were homicides (17,793).

        <h3>Stop Bullying</h3>
        <p>https://www.stopbullying.gov/</p>
        <p>
          When adults respond quickly and consistently to bullying behavior they send the message that it is not
          acceptable. Research shows this can stop bullying behavior over time. Parents, school staff, and other adults
          in the community can help kids prevent bullying by talking about it, building a safe school environment, and
          creating a community-wide bullying prevention strategy.
        </p>
        <h3>Suicidal Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Someone is acting differently than normal, such as always seeming sad or anxious, struggling to complete
          tasks, or not being able care for themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>Warning Signs for Bullying</h3>
        <p>https://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/warning-signs/index.html</p>
        <p>
          There are many warning signs that may indicate that someone is affected by bullying—either being bullied or
          bullying others. Recognizing the warning signs is an important first step in taking action against bullying.
          Not all children who are bullied or are bullying others ask for help.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to talk with children who show signs of being bullied or bullying others. These warning signs
          can also point to other issues or problems, such as depression or substance abuse. Talking to the child can
          help identify the root of the problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Why don't kids ask for help?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li className="liStats">
            Bullying can make a child feel helpless. Kids may want to handle it on their own to feel in control again.
            They may fear being seen as weak or a tattletale.
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">Kids may fear backlash from the kid who bullied them.</li>
          <li className="liStats">
            Bullying can be a humiliating experience. Kids may not want adults to know what is being said about them,
            whether true or false. They may also fear that adults will judge them or punish them for being weak.
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            Kids who are bullied may already feel socially isolated. They may feel like no one cares or could
            understand.
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            Kids may fear being rejected by their peers. Friends can help protect kids from bullying, and kids can fear
            losing this support.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Statistics from the 2012 Indicators of School Crime and Safety - PDF show that an adult was notified in less
          than half (40%) of bullying incidents. Kids don’t tell adults for many reasons:

        <h3>Bullying and Suicide</h3>
        <p>
          There is a strong link between bullying and suicide, as suggested by recent bullying-related suicides in the
          US and other countries. Parents, teachers, and students learn the dangers of bullying and help students who
          may be at risk of committing suicide.
        </p>
        <p>The statistics on bullying and suicide are alarming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li className="liStats">
            Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people, resulting in about 4,400 deaths per year,
            according to the CDC. For every suicide among young people, there are at least 100 suicide attempts. Over 14
            percent of high school students have considered suicide, and almost 7 percent have attempted it.
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            Bully victims are between 2 to 9 times more likely to consider suicide than non-victims, according to
            studies by Yale University
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            A study in Britain found that at least half of suicides among young people are related to bullying
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            10 to 14 year old girls may be at even higher risk for suicide, according to the study above
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            According to statistics reported by ABC News, nearly 30 percent of students are either bullies or victims of
            bullying, and 160,000 kids stay home from school every day because of fear of bullying
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some of the warning signs of suicide can include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li className="liStats">
            Showing signs of depression, like ongoing sadness, withdrawal from others, losing interest in favorite
            activities, or trouble sleeping or eating
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">
            Engaging in dangerous or harmful activities, including reckless behavior, substance abuse, or self injury
          </li>
          <li className="liStats">Saying or expressing that they can’t handle things anymore</li>
          <li className="liStats">Making comments that things would be better without them</li>
